DIABETES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by high levels of blood sugar (glucose) due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. It is a major global health issue, with millions of people affected worldwide, leading to serious complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and vision loss. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for reducing these risks. In recent years, machine learning models have been employed to predict diabetes onset, using data such as patient demographics, lifestyle factors, blood_glucose_level, Hemoglobin A1c level and medical history, to aid in early diagnosis and personalized healthcare.
